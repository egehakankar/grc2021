                        According to the World Health Organization(WHO), every year 1.35 million people die from road traffic accidents. Most of the deaths are among vulnerable pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists. Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) seem to be the perfect solution
                        to this problem. Radar sensors in AVs are affective devices since it simultaneously measures speed and range while being robust in bad weather conditions. In this work first, a dataset which contains 300 spectrograms are created
                        by simulating a 24GHz FMCW radar signals. In a 2D simulation environment, a single radar is placed to the origin, and other objects of varying parameters ( e.g height, heading, speed) are placed in this rectangular area. Then,
                        the features are extracted from the Micro-Doppler patterns on the spectrogram images and trained on Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs). The effectiveness of the proposed approach is first tested on a noiseless environment,
                        it achieved an average accuracy and a F1-score on the test set of 95% and outperformed some other methods. Then the robustness to noise is presented by comparing the test accuracy of the proposed method in different signal-to-noise
                        ratio(SNR) values.

                        Artificial intelligence (AI) in law and legal text processing are interrelated sub-fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and AI. The objective is to extract information from legal texts such as court cases and law articles as well as to develop
                        AI algorithms for legal decision support. It is known in the literature that word embeddings specifically trained with a domain-specific corpus related to the high-level NLP task at hand perform better than general word embeddings.
                        This study presents the first Turkish legal word embeddings (LawTurk2vec) in the literature that are designed for high-level NLP applications in the legal domain for Turkish. To test the semantic coherence of LawTurk2vec, the vectors
                        of the most frequent words of the corpus were analyzed. LawTurk2vec was also used in two high-level NLP tasks that process legal documents. These tasks are Name Entity Recognition (NER) in Turkish legal texts and predicting the
                        decisions of the Turkish courts. These tests show that the produced word embedding has a solid semantical capacity and has the potential to become a very useful material for researchers who are interested in processing Turkish
                        legal texts.

                        We develop the first model for the legal-domain specific Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Turkish legal documents. We then utilize deep neural network models to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) in this model. Content of this work bear on several
                        closely related areas of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in law and NER task, specifically in the Turkish law and language. As the first step of our investigation, we have constructed a corpus from the Republic of Turkey Court
                        of Cassation cases that contain domain-specific named entities such as legislation (LEG), court (COU), reference (REF) and official gazette (OFF) along with the generic named entities such as person (PER), location (LOC), organization
                        (ORG) and date (DAT). As a critical part of any NLP task, most fitting word representations are investigated. We experimented combinations of different embeddings; consisting of GloVe, Morph2Vec and neural network based character
                        feature extraction techniques either with Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Then we applied state-of-the-art NER model based on a Conditional Random Field (CRF) layer on top of a Bidirectional
                        LSTM architecture, where we reach 92.27% F1 score with a hybrid word representation of GloVe and Morph2Vec with character-level features extracted with LSTM.

                        A sememe is the minimum semantic unit of meaning in natural languages. Sememe Knowledge Bases (KBs), which contain words annotated with sememes, have been successfully applied to many NLP tasks. However, existing sememe KBs (SKBs) are constructed manually
                        by linguists over long periods of time, which inhibits their utilization. To address this issue, we propose a method to automatically construct a SKB from a Machine-Readable Dictionary (MRD). Well-established MRDs already exist,
                        some of which are online, and their construction is simpler compared to an SKB. Thus, the proposed method will allow for fast and extendable construction of SKBs. In our work, we use the famous WordNet database as our MRD, and
                        construct a SKB automatically.

                        Diachronic study is a prominent field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Linguistics that explores the evolution of the language with respect to time. Computational approaches on this subfield are recently gaining momentum and focus on identification
                        and categorization of meaning changes. In NLP, it is common to use word embeddings to mathematically derive the semantic properties of words. Diachronic studies benefit from the advances in word representation techniques and thus
                        semantic change identification became one of the most contemporary research topics. Our study introduces one of the novel ideas of word embeddings, Word2Gauss to the Diachronic NLP. Word2Gauss represents words as Gaussian mixture
                        models rather than generic vectors associated with words. Using this newly-added covariance information as well as the existing mean (word vector), we study Semantic Change Identification (SCI) task under SemEval 2020 Task 1 Challenge.
                        Our work is the first to explore Word2Gauss in this challenge. We use Orthogonal Procrustes Method to work on separately trained models and our results indicate that our procedure can be applied to multilingual corpora.

                        Word embeddings have been frequently used as representations of words that contains useful semantic information in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Traditional work in word embeddings maps each word to a point representation in a vector space. Recently,
                        it is shown that mapping instead to a density-based representation such as Gaussian distribution helps to capture the uncertainty of word semantics. Using multimodal word distributions formed from Gaussian mixtures also helps to
                        capture multiple word meanings (senses) besides the entailment and rich uncertainty information. However, in current studies, the number of Gaussian mixture modes (components) are selected by a parameter and fixed for all words,
                        whereas in real applications different words can have different number of senses (meanings). In our work, we propose a method to dynamically determine the number of modes of Gaussian mixture embeddings for each word. The methods
                        we have implemented use the number of different senses that a word has or estimate it. Thus, number of Gaussian mixture modes can be dynamically selected. Obtained results are compared on various word embedding benchmarks for word
                        similarity and entailment.

                        Word embeddings have become an important building block that are used profoundly in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Despite their several advantages, word embeddings can unintentionally accommodate some gender- and ethnicity-based biases that are present
                        within the corpus they are trained on. Therefore, ethical concerns beyond technical issues have been raised since word embeddings are extensively used in several high level algorithms. Detecting such biases in word embeddings and
                        debiasing them have recently become an important research endeavor as a sub-field of Artificial Intelligence and Ethics (AI and Ethics) as well as Explainable AI (XAI). Various studies have been conducted to measure to what extent
                        word embeddings capture biases and to eradicate biases from word embeddings. In our work, we approach gender bias problem from the scope of legal text processing domain. Several word embedding models trained on corpora composed
                        by legal documents from different countries have been utilized in order to measure and eliminate the gender bias in legal documents. Several methods have been employed to reveal the degree of the gender bias and observe its variations
                        over countries. Moreover, a popular debiasing method in the literature has been implemented and the obtained results have been compared and analyzed. Finally, overall results and their implications have been discussed in the scope
                        of NLP in legal domain.

                        Capacitive Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers (CMUT) are micro-scaled acoustics devices which are usually used in arrays for various applications such as medical imaging, accurate biometric sensing, pressure sensors, parametric speakers and many more.
                        The waterborne transmitting CMUT array designed in this work is to be used for medical imaging purpose, and therefore the priorities for design criteria were to maximize sensitivity, power output, uncollapsed mechanical swing and
                        widening the radiation directivity. Another significant improvement was the SNR which was the reason for maximizing the count of cells in the array. To improve the sensitivity, the design was made to compensate for the static depression.
                        The power output was maximized by designing to operate the CMUT without DC bias while taking care of the sensitivity and power output we will technically be able to achieve full gap uncollapsed swing. Since the directivity is the
                        function of radius, frequency and the pitch, the optimization was found while considering all the above desires simultaneously. The CMUT was chosen to be operating at 7.5 MHz and be driven by DiPhAS which allowed to have maximum
                        of 256 cells which for volumetric transmission meant a maximum of 16 x 16 array. The entire designing process for the array was done based on the large-signal equivalent circuit model. For the fabrication, wafer boding and flip-chip
                        bonding techniques were used where the process required only two lithography masks. After fabrication, the post-fabrication measurements and transducer characterization was performed to compare the device performance with the simulation
                        results.

                        Markov fluid queue models have served as one of the main tools for the performance analysis of computer and communication systems and networks. These models have also been used in other disciplines such as insurance risk, finance, inventory control, etc.
                        This work focuses on the time dependent (transient) analysis of Markov fluid queue models. In particular, a numerical method is proposed to obtain both the transient and first passage time distributions of a Multi-Regime Markov
                        Fluid Queue (MRMFQ). The proposed method is based on obtaining the steady-state solution of an auxiliary MRMFQ that is to be constructed from the original MRMFQ which then leads to the related transient measures of interest. First,
                        in order to model the deterministic time horizon, the Erlangization method is used. Then, as an alternative to Erlangization, ME-fication technique which efficiently replaces the Erlang distribution with a Concentrated Matrix Exponential
                        (CME), is used.

                        Age of Information (AoI) is a metric quantifying the freshness of knowledge about the status of an information source in a status update system. We consider such a system equipped with a sensor, a server and a destination. We restrict our interest to
                        the case of a single information source. The state of this information source changes in time and the source generates packets that contain data along with a time stamp. The server decides when and which of these packets are to
                        be sent to the destination. AoI of the information source is defined as the time elapsed since the generation of the last successfully received update packet at the destination. In this work, we obtain the exact distribution of
                        the AoI in the bufferless PH/PH/1/1 and PH/PH/1/1/P-LCFS queues and the single-buffer M/PH/1/2 and M/PH/1/2* queues. The proposed numerical methods are based on the theory of Markov fluid queues and vector-matrix operations. We
                        verify the proposed methods with simulations and compare the four queueing systems according to their AoI performance as a function of the system load and the squared coefficient of variation (scov) of service time.

                        "Segment routing in traffic engineering is a relatively new technique in the field of networking. Segment routing is a simpler form of source routing where the segments that a packet will follow are written in the header of the packet. Segments are identified
                        using Segment IDs known as SIDs. Node SIDs and Adjacency SIDs identify different types of segments. The first one identifies the shortest-path segments and latter identifies the direct link between two nodes. The ingress routers
                        direct packets towards their destinations using Equal Cost Multiple Path (ECMP), where traffic at a bifurcating node along the shortest path tree is equally divided among multiple shortest paths towards the destination. Recently,
                        several solutions have been proposed for traffic engineering using segment routing. The objective in these formulations is to minimize the maximum link utilization in the network. Integer linear programming formulations for the
                        problem generate solutions that are close to the solution obtained from the multi-commodity flow formulation for relatively small sized networks. However, the computation times increase beyond a reasonable time as the number of
                        nodes and segments increase. With these constraints, it is necessary to introduce new formulations and algorithms for the problem. We are currently investigating new formulations for the problem that contain fewer numbers of variables
                        and constraints compared to the recently introduced formulations. We are also planning to obtain nearly optimum solutions by using the relaxations of the integer linear programming formulation and then applying rounding techniques."

                        an information throughput of 9.34 Mb/s at 3.5 dB signal-to-noise ratio for a block length of 128 and code rate of 1/2.

                        simple terms, it is formed by a movable clamped top plate which has non-uniform displacement profile under pressure, stationary supporting substrate and a gap in between. As the pressure applied to the top plate changes, it's capacitance
                        changes and therefore the resonant frequency of the CMUT shifts. In previous works, it has been shown that this sensitivity on applied pressure can be used to obtain a static pressure sensor. With proposed method, we claim that
                        it is also possible to sense varying environment pressure again exploiting the resonant frequency behavior by forming an oscillator circuit and them feeding output of this circuit to a frequency demodulator for interpretation.

                            "Type-II superlattice (T2SL) structures enable the band structure to be engineered to fit the desired electrical and optical properties through the design of superlattice layers. For a design, the electronic band structure can be calculated with several
                            different ab-initio and semi-empirical methods. Among the semi-empirical methods, the k.p envelope function approximation (KPEFA) method, empirical tight binding method (ETBM), and 1D Kronig-Penney method (1DKP) are the most
                            frequently used approaches. In order to see the strengths and weaknesses of the methods, we numerically implemented them and compare the performances in terms the mostly concerned electronic parameters such as the bandgaps
                            and the effective masses. Another point was the analysis of the modeling capabilities of the methods for the effects of strain and interface layers since both effects can alter the band structure dramatically. Specifically,
                            for the 1DKP, we propose a way to include the strain effects with a similar approach of Pikus and Bir as well as the effects of interfaces with the inclusion of strained interface layers. With these two improvements, the level
                            of accuracy in the 1DKP model increased. Then, a comparison is made for the strain and interface effects as well as for accuracy improvement. Lastly, we also commented on a mostly disregarded issue in the literature of practical
                            concerns related to the easiness of the numerical implementation and the required computational power. The results of our simulations show that none of the stated methods overwhelm the others but the superiorities are stated

                            In this work, highly linear AlGaN/GaN laterally-gated (or buried gate) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) are reported. The effect of gate dimensions on source access resistance and the linearity of laterally-gated devices are investigated experimentally
                            in detail for the first time. Transistors with different gate dimensions and conventional planar devices are fabricated using two-step electron beam lithography (EBL). Current-voltage, source access resistance, small signal,
                            and two-tone measurements are performed to evaluate the linearity of devices. Contrary to conventional planar HEMTs, the intrinsic transconductance of laterally-gated devices monotonically increases with increasing gate voltage,
                            showing a similar behavior as junction FETs. The source access resistance shows a polynomial increase with the drain current, which can be reduced by decreasing the filling ratio of the buried gates. Through the optimization
                            of these two competing factors, i.e. intrinsic transconductance and the source access resistance, flat transconductance with high linearity is achieved experimentally. The laterally-gated structure shows flat transconductance
                            and small signal power gain over a larger span of gate voltage that is 2.5 times higher than a planar device. Moreover, 6.9 dB improvement in OIP3/PDC is achieved. This approach can be used to improve the linearity of AlGaN/GaN

                            The MEMS Gyroscopes have improved throughout the years in terms of performance and stability. The seek for higher stability devices is still being persuaded today. One of the most crucial setbacks for MEMS gyroscopes has been the long term drift problem
                            which is generated by the induced stress that is forced upon the system due to minor shifts within the mechanical structure due to various causes. One of the solutions that have been proposed to combat the errors generated
                            due to drift has been the use of stress sensors that measure the induced stress over two different points. The main goal of this project is to achieve the implementation of the stress sensors within a circular shaped gyroscope
                            which offers a unique singular anchor device morphology. This anchor achieves a single point contact between the moving mass to the bottom layer of the device. Due to this fact, the stress acted upon the device can be measured
                            more accurately and the number of required stress sensors is decreased. In this project, the various circular gyroscope designs have been researched and suited designs have been formed and simulated for fabrication and future

                        treatments usually varies over the course of the disease. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing treatment regimes under time-varying con- straints by using volatile contextual Gaussian process bandits. In particular,
                        we propose a variant of GP-UCB with volatile arms, which takes into account the patient’s context to- gether with the set of admissible treatments when recommending new treatments. Our Bayesian approach is able to provide treat-
                        ment recommendations to the patients along with confidence bounds which can be used for risk assessment. We use our algorithm to recommend bolus insulin doses for type 1 diabetes mellitus patients. Simulation stud- ies show that
                        our algorithm compares favor- ably with traditional blood glucose regulation methods.

                        the smoothness of the GP-sampled function and the structure of (X; d) to learn fast. In essence, Adaptive e-PAL employs a tree-based adaptive discretization technique to identify an e-accurate Pareto set of designs in as few evaluations

                        We consider the K-armed bandit setting where the learner proceeds in rounds, picking an arm in each round with the goal of maximizing his cumulative reward. This setting has been thoroughly studied, yet common algorithms, such as UCB1, epsilon-greedy,
                        and Thompson Sampling all have rigid and non-adaptive exploration/exploitation strategies, limiting any one algorithm from performing the best or close to the best in any given problem setup. To this end, we design a recurrent
                        neural network, called Exploration and Exploitation Memory Network (EEMN), that learns to imitate the exploration/exploitation strategies of the optimal algorithm in each problem setup, allowing it to competitively perform among
                        the best in any problem setup. We train and test our model on synthetically generated datasets that are generated with different arm distributions, where our model learns to imitate the best bandit algorithm in each setup. We then
                        experimentally show that for any given setup, our model performs very close to, or as good as, the best algorithm for that setup.

                        Combinatorial bandit models and algorithms are used in many sequential decision-making tasks ranging from item list recommendation to influence maximization. Typical algorithms proposed for combinatorial bandits, including combinatorial UCB (CUCB) and
                        combinatorial Thompson sampling (CTS) do not exploit correlations between base arms during the learning process. Moreover, their regret is usually analyzed under independent base arm outcomes. In this paper, we use Gaussian Processes
                        (GPs) to model correlations between base arms. In particular, we consider a combinatorial bandit model with probabilistically triggered arms, and assume that the expected base arm outcome function is a sample from a GP. We assume
                        that the learner has access to an exact computation oracle, which returns an optimal solution given expected base arm outcomes, and analyze the regret of Combinatorial Gaussian Process Upper Confidence Bound (CGP-UCB) algorithm
                        for this setting. Under (triggering probability modulated) Lipschitz continuity assumption on the expected reward function, we derive ($O( \sqrt{m T \log T \gamma_{T, \boldsymbol{\mu}}^{PTA}})$) $O(m \sqrt{\frac{T \log T}{p^*}})$
                        upper bounds for regret of CGP-UCB that hold with high probability, where $m$ denotes the number of base arms, $p^*$ denotes the minimum non-zero triggering probability, and $\gamma_{T, \boldsymbol{\mu}}^{PTA}$ denotes the pseudo-information
                        gain. Finally, we show via simulations that when the correlations between base arm outcomes are strong, CGP-UCB significantly outperforms CUCB and CTS.

                        Deployment of state of the art CNN architectures like Xception, ResNet and GoogleNet in resource limited devices is a big challenge. These architectures consist of many layers and millions of parameters. Moreover, they require billionsof floating point
                        operations to inference just an image. Therefore, memory spaceneeded to store parameters and to execute them are the main constraints for efficient convolutional neural network architectures.We examine Winograd’s minimal filtering
                        algorithms to reducenumber of floating point operations performed in convolutional layers. We reduce the number of multiplications x2.25 times without any accuracy loss. Moreover,we investigate, sparse and quantized Winograd’s
                        algorithms so that we can make conventional Winograd algorithms more memory efficient. We propose a linear quantization scheme to quantize weights of the networks more than 1-bit. We use ReLU activation function and Targeted Dropout
                        which is a variant of Dropout to prune transformed inputs of Winograd algorithm. We binarize weights so that most arithmetic operations are converted to bit-wise operations. We conduct several experiments on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100
                        datasets and discuss the classification performances of both conventional and modified Winograd minimal filtering algorithms. We achieve less than 1.7% classification error with ReLU-ed Winograd CNN compared to conventional Winograd.
                        We reduce memory requirements up to x32 times by binarizing weights of ReLU-ed Winograd CNN, and in return we incur around 2% accuracy loss. Lastly, for applications which are less tolerant to accuracy loss, rather than binarizing
                        weights we quantize them to 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit. Our quantized ReLU-ed Winograd CNNs reaches same accuracy levels as ReLU-ed Winograd CNNs.

                        methods have much greater computational requirements which is beyond the capabilities of wearables. Computational capacity and energy consumption are critical issues for wearable devices. Off-loading the data to external computational
                        sources such as edge/cloud servers provides high computational power which enables running complex algorithms for processing large amount of data. However, transmitting the data from wearable device to external server causes extra

                        memory and computational capabilities. In my presentation, I will introduce various approaches to enable ML and DL algorithms for wearable devices with low latency and low power consumption while preserving the model accuracy.

                        the base station(BS). We propose a downlink multiuser precoding scheme based on first reconstructing the channel matrix of each user using the feedback and employing available multiuser precoding algorithms to mitigate multiuser
                        interference. For the single stream case, signal-to-leakage-and-noise ratio (SLNR) based precoding scheme is employed and a lattice reduction aided block diagonalization type algorithm (LR-S-GMI-MMSE) is utilized for the full stream
                        case. Bit error rate simulations using 5G new radio (5G-NR) realistic channel models demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing eigenvector based (SVD-SI) algorithm.

                        In wireless communications, the channel between the transmitter and the receiver causes fading, which reduces the quality of the communication. To prevent this, channel estimation is performed at the receiver and used for coherent detection and interference
                        supression. 5G PBCH contains the master information block (MIB) together with the demodulation reference signals (DMRS) to enable channel estimation. Pilot based channel estimation is performed for coherent detection of the MIB
                        at the receiver. For initial access, it is mostly the case that the DMRS sequence is not known by the receiver, in which case the sequence is estimated by the DMRS search procedure. In this work, we investigate the channel estimation
                        performance of linear and Wiener interpolation applied on least squares (LS) based channel estimates. We also study the effect of the DMRS search on the channel estimation performance.

                        (i.e., improved localization performance of maximum-likelihood estimators at high signal-to-noise ratios), in the presence of restrictions on power consumption, illumination, and effective bandwidth usage; and (ii) minimizing the
                        total electrical power consumption in the LEDs subject to the relevant constraints in (i) along with a maximum localization CRLB limitation. Both of these optimization problems are shown to be convex, which facilitates their solution
                        via numerical means. Performance merits of the proposed signal design approach are demonstrated by the simulation results, in comparison to the optimal power allocation, uniform power allocation, and uniform signal design strategies.

                        on the probabilities of LEDs being Byzantine. Additionally, decision rules are designed for detection of Byzantine LEDs and based on training results, various ML based estimators are proposed. Cramér-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) is derived

                        Self-organisation is ubiquitous in nature from atomic, nanometre to kilometre scale. However, there is no general method that allows one to determine the resulting pattern, which has severely limited technological applicability of self-organised processes.
                        In contrast, it is well known in the laser community that a laser cavity evolves into the state in which its gain is maximised. Surprisingly, this result is not widely known outside of laser physics and was never proven. Here,
                        we show that during self-organisation, order is created from disorder through feedback. This allows us generalise the dictum of mode-locking as maximisation of the feedback gain. We corroborate maximisation of feedback gain with
                        an analogy to the celebrated path integral formulation in quantum mechanics. We demonstrate this principle in laser-induced self-organised formation of nano-structures. Engineering the amount of feedback seen by each competing
                        pattern enables us to direct the evolution of the self-organisation to virtually any final state. We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate fabrication of all possible Bravais lattices on a material surface. The approach
                        introduced here can be applied to a broad class of self-organised systems.

                        than the Shupe error in the fiber coil. Fiber coil has a cylindrical structure which is symmetrical around sensitive axis. We create a model which separates the bias errors arise from change in strain field in radial and axial
                        directions. Model covers the radial and axial strain distributions through the fiber coil and the radial and axial winding asymmetries. Strain field change is validated by OTDR measurements of a fiber coil. Bias calculation model
                        is also validated with laboratory FOG bias error measurements. We proposed different coil geometries, spool materials and winding techniques to decrease either radial or axial sensitivity, or both.

                        domain reflectometer (OTDR) measurements of a laboratory fiber optic gyroscope setup is presented. In literature, there are several works indicating the relation between strain and rate error and trying to reduce the total strain
                        as a whole [1], [2]. The strain analysis is separated into axial and radial gradients along the fiber coil. A new fiber coil structure using titanium as the spool material is designed and two fiber coils are produced. Fiber coils
                        are tested under a temperature profile ranging from 40 °C to +60 °C. Simulation and experimental results are consistent. Proposed coil design is promising with 8-fold reduction in rate error.

                        Camouflage design technologies have attracted tremendous attention over the past decades. With the usage of the metasurface design, the manipulation of the surface response became available and the invisibility in infrared region is achieved without using
                        any additional heating or cooling devices. In addition to the metasurfaces, using a special metal oxide material, vanadium dioxide, a dynamic feature is obtained by the camouflage design. VO2 has a transition to metal phase from
                        insulator phase with the increase in temperature. With the help of this unique property, the metasurface design remains transparent in the mid-infrared region even though the temperature of the structure is increased. Here in,
                        an all-dielectric metasurface mid-infrared adaptive thermal camouflage structure is designed by using VO2. The invisibility of the structure is shown using power calculations throughout different wavelength regions.

                        Materials with a tunable optical response that can be controllably tailored using external stimuli excitation have undergone considerable research effort for the development of active optical devices, such as thermo‐optical modulators. Although bismuth
                        (Bi) nanodots, embedded into glass matrices, have been proven to have a thermo‐optical response, the recyclability of the structure in solid–liquid phase transitions is a major challenge. Herein, a facile and lithography‐free fabrication
                        method is proposed to realize densely packed stand‐alone Bi nanorods (NRs), with deep subwavelength gaps and a resonance at the mid infrared range (λ ≅ 4.462 μm). Owing to these ultrasmall gaps that support lossy Mie‐like resonances,
                        strong field confinement is achieved, and the resonance wavelength exhibits great sensitivity to temperature, as the thermal sensitivity reaches as high as 1.0316 nm °C−1. This operation is conducted in the moderate temperature
                        interval of 25–85 °C, which is far from the melting point of Bi. Overall, our simple, robust, and high‐performance device is highly promising for realizing optical switches, thermo‐optic modulators, and infrared camouflage.

                        In our study, we examine multiple independent sources generating timely information through a single server queue. We analyze Age of Information (AoI), which have been used to measure the freshness of the information in a wide variety of systems. Firstly,
                        we examine AoI in a hybrid of Last Come First Serve (LCFS) and First Come First Serve (FCFS) PH/PH/1/1 queueing model where the interarrival and service times have phase-type distribution. Secondly, we examine AoI in single buffer
                        queue models (M/PH/1/2) where arrivals are memoryless. We propose exact models based on the theory of Markov Fluid Queues (MFQ) to numerically obtain AoI. Stationary distributions of AoI and peak AoI are obtained in matrix exponential
                        form, the moment generator function of which is available to calculate associated moments straightforwardly. After validation of our models with simulations, we find optimal replacement probabilities between different sources to
                        minimize the total mean of AoI in the studied queueing models.

                        Age of information (AoI) has been receiving increasing attention in numerous areas such as Internet of Things (IoT) enabled applications. In this study, we consider an information update system consisting multiple sources sending status packets to a monitor
                        through a single server which is occupied with a waiting room that has individual 1-packet buffer capacity for each source. When there exists multiple packets in the waiting room upon a service completion, the server is in charge
                        of deciding which source to serve according to a given policy. Under the assumption of Poisson packet arrivals and exponentially distributed service times for each source, we study several policies for minimizing the mean AoI and
                        the mean age violation probability at the monitor. Given a policy, we first propose and validate an analytical method for obtaining exact per-source distributions based on the theory of Markov fluid queues. Furthermore, we evaluate
                        the performance of each policy through numerical examples and show that the proposed policy consistently outperforms all other studied policies when the sources can have different arrival rates but same service rate.

                        In this talk, we will investigate the equilibrium behavior for the quadratic cheap talk problem in which an encoder and a decoder have misaligned objective functions, where the misalignment is due to a bias term. In prior work, it has been shown that
                        the number of bins under any Nash equilibrium has to be at most countable, generalizing a classical result due to Crawford and Sobel who considered sources with density supported on [0,1] -which is in stark contrast with the classical
                        source coding setup where the encoder and the decoder are aligned-. In this talk, we will focus on log-concave sources. We will establish the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria with any number of bins considering log-concave
                        sources with two-sided unbounded support. A similar result holds also for sources with semi-infinite support except that there may be an upper bound on the number of bins depending on technical conditions stated explicitly. In
                        particular, we will derive conditions under which the upper bound on the number of bins is one meaning that the only equilibrium is non-informative. Moreover, we will establish that when the source distribution is log-concave,
                        the equilibrium costs diminish as the number of bins increases, i.e., an equilibrium with more bins is preferred by the decision makers. In addition, connections with the classical theory of optimal quantization and convergence

                        Application performance of mechanical positioning systems might not coincide with the theory, mainly due to nonlinearities or imperfections of system models. Although it is sometimes possible to ignore these mismatches, systems generally suffer from performance
                        degradation or even instability eventually. Especially, friction force and time delay are two major factors of these undesired effects. Hence, in this paper, Smith predictor-based controllers and adaptive Coulomb friction observers
                        are designed to enhance position tracking performance of a mechanical system including time delay. The first proposed observer structure is mainly motivated by the Friedland-Park observer but could be considered as an extension
                        of it which characterizes a general class of nonlinear functions for friction estimation. Then, Lyapunov based another observer is proposed to evaluate estimation performances. To assure its functionality with delayed measurements,
                        different velocity predictor schemes are designed, and their performances are compared. As a guideline for observer design, some conditions for exponential stability and robustness analysis are presented. Simulation results demonstrate
                        that the proposed control system enhances the tracking performance even when the actual friction is a compound of various static and dynamic terms.

                        is developed by using STAFF III database composed of raw recordings acquired before and during coronary balloon angioplasty performed in 104 coronary artery disease patients by using data acquisition equipment with wide frequency
                        bandwidth and high sampling rate. The database is constructed as a part of a clinical research study to investigate induced ECG anomalies that occur during MI. A signal processing technique that simultaneously obtains SKNA and
                        ECG from wideband recordings on STAFF III database is developed. A novel feature extraction technique that obtains ECG features that are most discriminative for reliable detection of MI is developed. A novel supervised learning
                        technique based on artificial neural network (ANN) which performs robust detection of MI is developed. An unsupervised learning technique based on Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Neyman Pearson approach which performs robust detection
                        of MI using only basal ECG data is developed. Findings of study demonstrated that there is an increase in amplitude of SKNA during MI which is accompanied by simultaneous repolarization anomalies in ECG. It is further shown that
                        anomalies that occur in SKNA during MI are associated with ST/T anomalies in ECG. Performance results of proposed ANN-based supervised learning technique over STAFF III database showed that the technique provides highly reliable
                        detection of MI by performing robust detection of ECG anomalies. In cases where diagnostic information of ECG is not sufficient for reliable diagnosis of MI, proposed technique can provide early and accurate diagnosis of MI, which

                        Main-stream deep learning-based MR image reconstruction models are either data-driven supervised approaches or physics-guided self-supervised approaches. In supervised models, aim is to learn a mapping function from under-sampled k-space image to fully-sampled
                        k-space image. In supervised approaches, models are usually trained with pixel-wise, adversarial or perceptual losses and models can achieve success in reconstruction of high quality MR images. However, they require fully sampled
                        dataset and in many real-life imaging cases, acquisition of fully sampled k-space image is not feasible due to scan durations, patient motion etc.. As an answer to dependency of fully sampled k-space data, self-supervised approaches
                        have been proposed. In these methods, acquired k-space data are split into 2 disjoint sets. One of these sets is used as an input for models and the other one is used for loss calculation. Although self-supervised approaches reduce
                        the dependency of fully-sampled datasets, they suffer loss of spatial resolution as a result of their nature. To increase the model performance of self-supervised approaches, here we propose a novel transfer-learning approach that

                        Echo Planar Imaging (EPI) is a commonly used acquisition method for diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI) and functional MRI (fMRI). Due to the long readout duration and reduced bandwidth, alongside the large gradient magnitudes typically required, EPI acquisitions
                        suffer from susceptibility-induced artifacts that distort the images by causing displacements in the phase-encode direction. These artifacts reduce the usefulness of dMRI/fMRI data for advanced analyses such as white matter integrity
                        and tractography. One method for alleviating these artifacts is to acquire two scans with identical parameters but opposite phase-encode directions, such that the distortions are in opposing directions and the displacement between
                        the two scans can be estimated as a displacement field. Traditionally, iterative optimization methods are used for this purpose which tend to have a slow convergence time. We propose to overcome this by leveraging a neural-network-based
                        algorithm that learns the mapping from the distorted data to the displacement field and utilizes it to correct the images. This algorithm aims to reduce the processing time of the correction process.

                        Many deep learning methods for accelerated MRI reconstruction task are based on supervised and conditional networks. These methods generally rely on paired datasets containing both undersampled and fully-sampled acquisitions to learn underlying mapping
                        between them. Therefore, a separate model has to be trained to account potential changes in undersampling rate, image contrast and sampling density which may be impractical in real cases. To overcome this limitation we propose
                        a zero-shot learning approach for accelerated MRI reconstructions. The proposed approach learns structural priors from DICOM images available in public MRI databases and uses this prior in a style-generative manner to reconstruct
                        test images regardless of acceleration rate, image contrast or undersampling pattern.

                        this issue, we propose a few-shot learning approach via hybrid architectures that couple data-driven priors obtained from small training sets with subject-specific priors obtained from physical signal models. Evaluations on multi-coil

                        In this research, a CUDA-based GPU accelerated implementation of Method of Moments (MOM) for the solution of Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) will be presented. Solution is based on the discretization of the frequency domain EFIE with Rao-Wilton-Glisson
                        (RWG) basis functions and to use a Galerkin testing procedure. Design of efficient parallel algorithms to fill the impedance matrix and for its inversion are addressed. Depending on these algorithms, our aim is to improve the overall
                        efficiency of the method on GPU cores. Furthermore, an MLFMA implementation on GPU for EFIE will be considered as well.

                        " Scattering problems in electromagnetics are usually solved via surface and volume integral equations. In particular, if the volume of interest is not homogeneous, use of volume integral equations is inevitable. In this study we will use D-type volume
                        integral equation by modeling the volume of interest with tetrahedrons and using Schabert-Wilton-Glisson (SWG) basis functions.Then, the resultant integral equation will be solved using multilevel fast multi-pole algorithm (MLFMA).
                        However, for extremely large problems, the matrix-vector multiplications at each iteration is still the bottleneck of the solution process. Therefore, we will accelerate the efficiency of the solution procedure by using a machine
                        learning algorithm."

                        Capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducers (CMUTs) are MEMS structures that can be used as transmitters and receivers in ultrasonic applications. In receiver mode, these capacitive devices produce current signals, which need to be converted to voltage
                        signals to be processed in the following steps. A simple resistive termination or a single stage amplifier cannot be used due to the bandwidth constraints. For this purpose, a low noise resistive feedback transimpedance amplifier
                        (TIA) design is proposed for 50μm radius CMUT cells operating at 7.5MHz. A cascode common source structure is used for the amplifier. The proposed TIA is designed on Cadence Virtuoso with the XFAB XC06M3 process. The TIA yields
                        0.5pA/√Hz input referred noise with 120kΩ transimpedance gain and 25MHz bandwidth. The power consumption is 3.3mW.

                        DC/DC Boost converters are extensively used in many power electronics applications like solar systems, wind energy systems, uninterruptable power supplies, electric vehicles etc. Fundamental performance criteria in these applications include tight output
                        voltage regulation, reference tracking and fast response to load and input voltage transients. In order to meet these performance requirements, a boundary control method is developed. First, normalized plant model is obtained for
                        resistive loaded boost converter. The normalization generalizes the controller design by making it independent of the circuit parameters. Then, natural phase plane trajectories of the system are derived in normalized domain. It
                        is shown that these trajectories are in logarithmic and spiral forms for two different states of switch in the system. A special boundary control law is defined which employs the natural trajectories of the converter as switching
                        surfaces to generate the control input. It is observed via MATLAB simulations that the proposed controller achieves fast dynamic response and manages to recover steady state operation by single switching action during transients.
                        Finally, the control law is altered by a small factor so that in steady state, finite frequency operation and known ripple magnitudes of states are obtained. By this way, a common problem in boundary control applications called
                        chattering is eliminated.

                        based on distributed topology. Various broadband amplifiers has been proposed in both GaAs and GaN based semiconductor technologies. Although GaAs based amplifiers have superior performance at high frequencies, GaN offers higher
                        power density. In order to further improve output power and power-added efficiency (PAE) using GaN based process over up to a decade bandwidth, a non-uniform distributed power amplifier (NDPA) topology is typically used. In this

                        We investigate spatio-temporal event analysis using point processes. Inferring the dynamics of event sequences spatio-temporally has many practical applications including crime prediction, social media analysis, and traffic forecasting. In particular,
                        we focus on spatio-temporal Hawkes processes that are commonly used due to their capability to capture excitations between event occurrences. We introduce a novel inference framework based on randomized transformations and gradient
                        descent to learn the process. We replace the spatial kernel calculations by randomized Fourier feature-based transformations. The introduced randomization by this representation provides flexibility while modeling the spatial excitation
                        between events. Moreover, the system described by the process is expressed within closed-form in terms of scalable matrix operations. During the optimization, we use maximum likelihood estimation approach and gradient descent while
                        properly handling positivity and orthonormality constraints. The experiment results show the improvements achieved by the introduced method in terms of fitting capability in synthetic and real-life datasets with respect to the
                        conventional inference methods in the spatio-temporal Hawkes process literature. We also analyze the triggering interactions between event types and how their dynamics change in space and time through the interpretation of learned
                        parameters.

                        We study non-stationary spatio-temporal sequence prediction in sparse time-series data. Our approach is based on modeling spatial and temporal patterns via spatially-switching self-exciting point processes. Although we specifically use self-exciting point
                        processes, specifically the Hawkes process, our approach can be readily extended to any other Cox process. Due to non-stationary characteristics in many real-life data, we extend our formulation to capture changing dynamics. We
                        particularly develop a decision tree based spatial partitioning mechanism, which separates the whole spatial region into subregions. Each subregion is modeled by an individual intensity function, where all intensities are interacting.
                        Thus, we successfully formulate and apply a spatio-temporal point process that jointly optimizes the subregion boundaries and the point process parameters. We also present a gradient-based optimization procedure that is also applicable
                        to online setups. Finally, we show that our approach is superior to other point-process and deep learning-based methods on real-life earthquake and check-in data through an extensive set of experiments.

                        We study collaborative machine learning (ML) systems where a massive dataset is distributed across independent workers which compute their local gradient estimates based on their own datasets. Workers send their estimates through a multipath fading multiple
                        access channel (MAC) with orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) to mitigate the frequency selectivity of the channel. We assume that the parameter server (PS) employs multiple antennas to align the received signals
                        with no channel state information (CSI) at the workers. To reduce the power consumption and the hardware costs, we employ complex-valued low resolution digital to analog converters (DACs) and analog to digital converters (ADCs),
                        respectively, at the transmitter and the receiver sides to study the effects of practical low cost DACs and ADCs on the learning performance of the system. Our theoretical analysis shows that the impairments caused by low-resolution
                        DACs and ADCs, including the extreme case of one-bit DACs and ADCs, do not prevent the convergence of the learning algorithm, and the multipath channel effects vanish when a sufficient number of antennas are used at the PS. We
                        also validate our theoretical results via simulations, and demonstrate that using low resolution, even one-bit, DACs and ADCs causes only a slight decrease in the learning accuracy.

                        Being one of the most common empirical regularities, the Zipf's law for word frequencies is a power law relation between word frequencies and frequency ranks of words. We quantitatively study semantic uncertainty of words through non-point distribution-based
                        word embeddings and reveal the Zipfian regularities. Uncertainty of a word can increase due to polysemy, the word having "broad" meaning (such as the relation between broader "emotion" and narrower "exasperation") or a combination
                        of both. Variances of Gaussian embeddings are utilized to quantify the extent a word can be used in different senses or contexts. By using the variance information embedded in the non-point Gaussian embeddings, we quantitatively
                        show that semantic breadth of words also exhibits Zipfian patterns, when polysemy is controlled. This outcome is complementary to Zipf's law of meaning distribution and the related meaning-frequency law by indicating the existence
                        of Zipfian patterns: more frequent words tends to be generic while less frequent ones tend to be specific. Results for two languages, English and Turkish that belong to different language families, are also provided. Such regularities
                        provide valuable information to extract and understand relationships between semantic properties of words and word frequencies. In various applications, performance improvements can be obtained by employing these regularities.
                        We also propose a method that leverages the Zipfian regularity to improve the performance of baseline textual entailment detection algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, our approach is the first quantitative study that uses
                        Gaussian embeddings to examine the relationships between word frequencies and semantic breadth.

                        Natural language processing (NLP) based approaches have recently received attention for legal systems of several countries. It is of interest to study the wide variety of legal systems that have so far not received any attention. In particular, for the
                        legal system of the Republic of Turkey, codified in Turkish, no works have been published. We first review the state-of-the-art of NLP in law, and then study the problem of predicting verdicts for several different courts, using
                        several different algorithms. This study is much broader than earlier studies in the number of different courts and the variety of algorithms it includes. Therefore, it provides a reference point and baseline for further studies
                        in this area. We further hope the scope and systematic nature of this study can set a framework that can be applied to the study of other legal systems. We present novel results on predicting the rulings of the Turkish Constitutional
                        Court and Courts of Appeal, using only fact descriptions, and without seeing the actual rulings. The methods that are utilized are based on Decision Tree (DTs), Random Forests (RFs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Long Short-Term
                        Memory networks (LSTMs). The prediction results for all algorithms are given in a comparative and detailed manner. We demonstrate that outcomes of the courts of Turkish legal system can be predicted with high accuracy, especially
                        with deep learning based methods. The presented results show similar performance to the existing ones in the literature for other languages and legal systems.

                        We consider contextual combinatorial volatile multi-armed bandit (CCV-MAB), in which at each round, the learner observes a set of available base arms and their contexts, and then, selects a super arm that contains K base arms in order to maximize its
                        cumulative reward. Under the semi-bandit feedback setting and assuming that the contexts lie in a space X endowed with the Euclidean norm and that the expected base arm outcomes (expected rewards) are Lipschitz continuous in the
                        contexts (expected base arm outcomes), we propose an algorithm called Adaptive Contextual Combinatorial Upper Confidence Bound (ACC-UCB). This algorithm, which adaptively discretizes X to form estimates of base arm outcomes and
                        uses an α-approximation oracle as a subroutine to select a super arm in each round, achieves O~(T(D¯+1)/(D¯+2)+ϵ) regret for any ϵ>0, where D¯ represents the approximate optimality dimension related to X. This dimension captures
                        both the benignness of the base arm arrivals and the structure of the expected reward. In addition, we provide a recipe for obtaining more optimistic regret bounds by taking into account the volatility of the base arms and show
                        that ACC-UCB achieves significant performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art for worker selection in mobile crowdsourcing.

                        System matrix calibration for magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a time-consuming process. The calibration process is conducted by filling a cube shaped sample with magnetic nanoparticles (MNP) and measuring it across the field of view for each pixel.
                        Hence, while the calibration time is directly proportional to the number of pixels in the final image, Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is inversely proportional to the used MNP sample size. Hence, to calibrate the system matrix for
                        smaller resolution with the same SNR, one would need to increase calibration time exponentially. In this study, we present a novel image reconstruction technique for high resolution MPI. We propose using interpolation to approximate
                        high resolution system matrices, from low-resolution measurements. We show that even linear interpolation techniques combined with non-linear image reconstruction can improve image resolution. We demonstrate the increase in image
                        resolution without any additional calibration time requirement on both simulation and experimental data.

                        Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) attains a focal position in clinical neuroimaging due to its unique capacity to depict multi-contrast images of the same underlying anatomy within an exam session. The multi-contrast images, in turn, accumulate complementary
                        knowledge for subsequent image analysis tasks and radiological investigations, yet extended exam sessions are frequently observed as a limitation to collect a complete array of the desired contrasts. To alleviate this limitation,
                        previous studies have successfully shown deep neural network models that are trained in supervised learning frameworks to synthesize missing (target) contrast images from available (source) contrast images. However, these models
                        inherently manifest an undesirable dependence on training sets of costly fully-sampled source or ground-truth target contrast acquisitions, which might be impractical to acquire in practice. To this end, we propose a novel weakly-supervised
                        learning model for accelerated multi-contrast MRI, namely wsGAN, that enables training with only undersampled acquisitions. To do this, wsGAN utilizes a selective loss function defining the network error only on the acquired k-space
                        coefficients and leverages randomized sampling patterns across the subjects in the training set to effectively learn the relationship between the acquired and nonacquired k-space coefficients. ssGAN further permits direct synthesis
                        from undersampled source contrast images to reduce data requirements in multi-contrast MRI synthesis accelerated across both tissue contrasts and k-space samples. Comprehensive evaluations on multi-contrast brain images denote
                        that the proposed model maintains equivalent performance (Kruskal-Wallis significance testing) with the gold-standard supervised model.

                        Color magnetic particle imaging (MPI) techniques have recently gained popularity, with the purposes of distinguishing different nanoparticle types or nanoparticles in different environments. In this work, we extend a relaxation-based color MPI technique
                        that we recently proposed, and make it applicable to rapid trajectories that distort the underlying mirror symmetry of the adiabatic MPI signal. We propose a method to recover the mirror symmetry with delay and signal amplitude
                        compensations. The proposed technique rapidly produces a relaxation map of the scanned region, without any prior information about the nanoparticles.

                        Metasurfaces are subwavelength-thick constructs, consisting of discrete meta-cells that approximate the optical response required for the desired function. Required phase responses are commonly implemented via Pancharatnam-Barry topologies and/or narrowband
                        resonators. These methodologies fail to address the functionalities that are both achromatic and polarization insensitive. Recently, polarization-converting structures have been utilized for the implementation of broadband and
                        achromatic metasurface lenses (metalenses), but the fundamental problem of efficiency still remains unsolved. This obstacle can be traced back to the common design methodology for metasurfaces, in which the possible meta-cell geometries
                        are limited to uncoupled operation for spatial independence and ease of design process. However, for achromatic focusing, the phase response is highly correlated spatially and spectrally, therefore does not benefit from the independent
                        operation. Here, instead of using a variety of uncoupled meta-cells in periodic placement, we propose and show highly-coupled, identical dielectric pillars with varying inter-scatterer coupling as metasurface building blocks. This
                        paradigm shift enables a new fabric of scatterers arrayed irregularly to interact strongly with the incoming wave while providing full 0-2π phase response coverage. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we implemented two achromatic
                        metalenses based on the proposed nanopillar fabrics achieving record efficiency levels across the entire 400-700nm band: a cylindrical lens with 85% operational efficiency and a circular, polarization-insensitive lens with 65%
                        operational efficiency. These make the first account of inter-coupled metasurface architecture.

                        In recent years colloidal semiconductor quantum wells, also nicknamed nanoplatelets (NPLs), have emerged as an important alternative to epitaxially-grown semiconductor quantum wells in the field of optoelectronics. These few monolayer thick quasi-2D quantum
                        wells exhibit very narrow emission linewidth as a result of their vertical thickness precise to the atomic level and giant oscillation strength, making them suitable for light-emitting diodes and lasing. On the other hand, for
                        photovoltaic applications, silicon is the most dominant semiconducting material. However, being an indirect bandgap, silicon suffers from poor optical absorption. In this study, we propose and demonstrate a workaround by taking
                        advantage of the large absorption cross-section of these nanoplates self-assembled into all face-down orientation and integrated onto a Si platform. In the ensuing hybrid structure, incident light is absorbed by the face-down NPL
                        monolayer and photogenerated excitons are funneled to the silicon via dipole-dipole coupling. Here, depositing an alumina spacer layer with fine-tuned thickness, we systematically studied and developed a new understanding for the
                        underlying FRET distance (d) dependency of the decay kinetics of these donor NPLs on silicon. Surprisingly, we found that the energy transfer efficiency scales with d-1, which is much slower than the expected and is thus more effective
                        deeper into Si. We further confirmed these energy transfer efficiency levels calculated from the time-resolved fluorescence (TRF) spectroscopy measurements using full electromagnetic modeling and solutions. Our EM calculations
                        explain that the observed FRET dependency of d-1 emerges as a consequence of the electric field delocalization in the quasi- 2 D layer of face-down oriented NPLs. These findings indicate that such face-down assembly of NPLs is
                        highly promising for FRET-enhanced photosensitization on Si-based photovoltaic systems.

                        Full-wave solutions for electromagnetic (EM) problems can be obtained by solving Maxwell’s equations with proper boundary conditions for many years. Many methods have been investigated to obtain efficient and accurate solutions such as high frequency
                        techniques, partial-differential-equation techniques and integral-equation techniques. Method of Moments (MoM) is an integral-equation-based numerical technique, which provides accurate solutions for EM problems. To improve the
                        computational efficiency of MoM, some methods, such as Fast Multipole Method (FMM) and its extension Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm (MLFMA), were introduced. Yet, these methods suffer low-frequency breakdown caused by diagonalization
                        for multiscale problems and electrically small structures. Therefore, we propose a novel algorithm, which eliminates the low-frequency breakdown by using the machine-learning-based Green’s function estimator and provides an efficient
                        solution by using the similar hierarchical approach to the MLFMA. Numerical results show that the algorithm solves the electromagnetic scattering problems.

                        We investigate unsupervised anomaly detection for high-dimensional data and introduce a deep metric learning (DML) based framework. In particular, we learn a distance metric through a deep neural network. Through this metric, we project the data into
                        the metric space that better separates the anomalies from the normal data and reduces the effect of the curse of dimensionality for high-dimensional data. We present a novel data distillation method through self-supervision to
                        remedy the conventional practice of assuming all data as normal. We also employ the hard mining technique from the DML literature. We show these components improve the performance of our model and significantly reduce the running
                        time. Through an extensive set of experiments on the 14 real-world datasets, our method demonstrates significant performance gains compared to the state-of-the-art unsupervised anomaly detection methods, e.g., an absolute improvement
                        between 4.44% and 11.74% on the average over the 14 datasets. Moreover, we extend our framework to online federated learning setting to detect traffic accidents from 100 CCTV streams on different devices in real-time while learning

                        "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are widely used for online regression due to their ability to generalize nonlinear temporal dependencies. As an RNN model, Long-Short-Term- Memory Networks (LSTMs) are commonly preferred in practice, as these networks
                        are capable of learning long-term dependencies while avoiding the vanishing gradient problem. However, due to their large number of parameters, training LSTMs requires considerably longer training time compared to simple RNNs (SRNNs).
                        In this paper, we achieve the online regression performance of LSTMs with SRNNs efficiently. To this end, we introduce a first-order training algorithm with a linear time complexity in the number of parameters. We show that when
                        SRNNs are trained with our algorithm, they provide very similar regression performance with the LSTMs in two to three times shorter training time. We provide strong theoretical analysis to support our experimental results by providing

                        We show that our system is min-max optimal by deriving both its performance guarantees and the related adversarial (worst-case) lower bounds for first-order methods (i.e. partial knowledge of loss functions). These lower bounds
                        capture the time-varying nature of the environment, and the complexity of the competition sequences (i.e. the overall successive changes in a sequence). We exemplify the scenarios related to this learning problem and the corresponding

                        play-styles, ii) other learning agents and iii) human. Specifically, we first determine a number of macro actions based on human heuristics. We then generically compose these macro actions by using low-level-actions provided by
                        the game. We allow reinforcement agents to only have the macro actions in their action spaces. Training reinforcement agents with macro actions in a RTS game causes certain problems such as additional complexity of credit assignment

                        has been developed to reduce RCS. The main purpose of reducing the RCS is that radar receivers are unable to detect these targets if small portion of transmitted signal backscatters from these targets. Hence, the planes with ‘stealth’
                        property are flat underneath so that the signal is forward scattered. In order to overcome low radar cross section, there are some radar systems has been developed one of which is MIMO radar. MIMO radar systems offer promising
                        performance for stealth targets. Each of the receivers processes the received signals coherently then, the processed signals are integrated. MIMO radars can use angularly varying RCSs of targets and provide spatial diversity gain
                        in target detection, target position and Doppler velocity estimation stages.

                        Direction of arrival (DoA) estimation by using sensor arrays is a wide research area with applications in RADAR, SONAR, wireless communications, etc. Compressive sensing (CS) theory exploits the sparsity of signals a priori which has given rise to the
                        development of CS based DoA estimation techniques. These techniques perform well in sparse target environments and can operate on the compressed sensor measurements which are achieved by undersampling the analog sensor outputs
                        in far fewer number of digital channels than the number of sensors. Measurement matrices determine how this operation is performed, and hence are among the major factors affecting the estimation performance. In this study, we propose
                        an adaptive measurement matrix design methodology enabling significant measurement compression rates. Superior performance of the proposed technique over many alternatives is also demonstrated by using Monte Carlo simulations.

                        "Specific Emitter Identification (SEI) is the process of specifically identifying mobile transmitters by extracting unique features from the precise measurements of their emitted signals. A novel signal processing scheme with two stages is proposed for
                        the identification of specific radar emitters. In the first stage, the received radar pulses are accurately time aligned and coherently integrated in order to increase the Signal-to- Noise (SNR) ratio. Using this technique, measurements
                        with SNR improvements of more than 25 dB are obtained, enabling detection of subtle differences between different emitters. In the second step, Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is used to decompose both the envelope and the
                        instantaneous frequency of the received signal into a set of modes. Then, these mod signals are characterized by using a group of features for identification. We demonstrate highly successful identification performance with the

                        Many natural signals and signals used in engineering and interdisciplinary fields are composed of multiple components which may have time-varying frequency content. The identification and extraction of these components is important because they may convey
                        important information about the behavior of the system. Recently developed variational mode decomposition (VMD) concept provides pure sinusoidal component extraction in an optimal sense. Extending the VMD concept to include non–stationary
                        and time-limited signal components, Variational Multi–Component Signal Decomposition (VMCSD) algorithm is proposed. Using the estimated time-frequency support (TFS) information, VMCSD demodulates each component into a pure sinusoidal
                        form, extracts the demodulated components from the composite signal and modulate back the extracted component into its original form.

                        Mostly, the optimal H-infinity controllers designed for systems with time delay are infinite dimensional, which needs to be approximated to a finite order suboptimal controller for implementation on physical systems. Various methods have been suggested

                        Reduced field-of-view (FOV) imaging techniques excite only the region of interest to enable aliasing-free imaging with fewer phase encoding (PE) lines and increased resolution. The reduction in PE lines improves the in-plane off-resonance robustness during
                        echo-planar imaging (EPI). However, the conventional 2DRF pulses used for reduced-FOV imaging are considerably longer than their 1D counterparts, which makes them sensitive to through-plane off-resonance issues. Furthermore, the
                        replicas along the blipped axis of the excitation k-space trajectory can limit the slice coverage. In this work, we propose a sheared 2DRF pulse excitation to achieve significantly reduced pulse durations with improved off-resonance
                        robustness and enhanced SNR. A sheared trajectory was designed to cover the same excitation k-space extent and to achieve the same excitation profile as the produced standard 2DRF pulse. Based on the shearing angle, the number
                        of trajectory lines were automatically adjusted to minimize the 2DRF pulse duration, while ensuring that the replicas are pushed outside the potential slice locations. The relationship between slab sharpness, slab and slice thickness
                        with sheared 2DRF pulse duration was analyzed. In vivo reduced-FOV T2-weighted imaging was conducted in the cervical spinal cord of a healthy subject, on a 3T MRI scanner. 1DRF excitation with additional fat suppression, standard
                        2DRF pulse and sheared 2DRF pulse were applied for performance comparison. The in vivo imaging results in the cervical spine demonstrate that the sheared 2DRF pulse improves SNR, eliminates the slice coverage limitations, and maintains
                        inherent fat suppression capability.

                        Gradient array systems have been used to generate dynamically controllable magnetic field profiles. In these systems, multiple gradient coils are driven individually by independent gradient power amplifiers (GPAs). The accuracy of gradient current waveforms
                        has a significant effect on the image quality and providing gradient coil currents with high fidelity might be challenging due to mutual coupling between coils, GPA imperfections, and time-varying parameters in gradient hardware.
                        Although considering the first-order model in the feedforward including mutual coupling provides adequate currents to the coils, residual errors due to measurement errors in the determination of model parameters, not considering
                        GPAs in the model, high order effects and time-varying parameters can still decrease the accuracy of coil currents time-courses. Closed-loop feedback can be used to overcome these imperfections. In this work, a digital real-time
                        (proportional–integral–derivative) PID controller is designed to compensate for the above-mentioned effects which are not corrected by the feedforward model. The controller also decreases current waveforms sensitivity to the time-varying

                        Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) uses sinusoidal drive fields to excite the magnetic nanoparticles. These time-varying fields up to 150 kHz form electric fields within the body, which in turn can cause peripheral nerve stimulation, also known as magnetostimulation.
                        Magnetostimulation is the main safety concern for MPI for time-varying fields up to 150 kHz. For the growing interest in head-size MPI systems, there is a need to determine these safety limits. In this work, we design for a human
                        head-size magnetostimulation coil with a Rutherford cable winding to be used in human-subject magnetostimulation experiments. This setup achieves 12-fold reduction in the voltages needed to generate the required magnetic fields,
                        facilitating the safety of human subject experiments.

                        Agar-agar phantoms doped with paramagnetic materials are commonly used to assess MRI protocols and image reconstruction techniques qualitatively. These phantoms are typically prepared using cylindrical containers and the paramagnetic gels are prepared
                        to mimic the T1/T2 characteristics of human soft tissues. In this work, we propose a 1:1 scale human head and neck agar-agar phantom prepared using a 3D human model to assess EPI protocols. The phantom mimics human tissue characteristics
                        with the agar-agar gel while incorporating the anatomy of the skull and cervical vertebrae. The EPI images show that the phantom closely resembles human anatomy and the artifacts successfully mimic susceptibility artifacts seen
                        during in vivo brain and spine MRI.

                        Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) is a recently introduced medical imaging modality using the nonlinear magnetization response of superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) nanoparticles. Partial FOV Center Imaging (PCI) is a novel robust x-space image reconstruction
                        for MPI developed with the motivation of eliminating non-ideal effects on the signal. PCI and Lumped-PCI methods offer a trade-off between interference and noise robustnesses. PCI offers robustness against harmonic interferences,
                        whereas Lumped PCI offers robustness against noise. Our aim is to develop an image reconstruction technique for MPI that simultaneously improves interference and noise robustness, effectively combining PCI and Lumped-PCI in an
                        optimized fashion.

                        In vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs), all vehicles should periodically broadcast beacon messages to increase road-traffic safety and to improve traffic management. Beaconing mechanism proposed in IEEE802.11p standard does not guarantee the reliability
                        of beacon messages since they cannot be acknowledged in a reliable manner. Also, IEEE802.11p standard does not guarantee the timeliness of beacon messages since the beacon rate used by all vehicles are equal and constant in all
                        circumstances without considering requirements of safety-related applications and channel congestion. Therefore, beaconing mechanism proposed in IEEE 802.11p standard performs poorly at high network load due to collisions and increasing
                        update delays. In this study, firstly, beacon transmission rate adaptation mechanism is modelled using realistic traffic flow model and considering the requirements of safety related applications and channel congestion. Then, in
                        order to increase reliability of beaconing mechanism, full-duplex (FD) transceivers are used. FD transceiver allows transmitters to monitor the channel usage while transmitting without waiting for a timeout, and back-off as soon
                        as collision is detected. Therefore, it is possible to detect beacon packet collisions in a timely manner even before the frame transmission ends. However, due to the residual self-interference (RSI), FD transceivers cannot perfectly
                        sense the channel, which causes false alarm and miss detection errors in collision detection mechanism. Finally, in order to increase timeliness of beacon messages, queue is modelled in such a way that reduces the age of information.
                        System level simulations are conducted by using realistic vehicle traffic model, beacon rate adaptation mechanism, FD transceivers, and queue model that reduces the information age, and by taking RSI effect on FD transceivers into
                        consideration.

                        This work presents a high throughput and energy efficient multicore (MC) successive cancellation (SC) decoder architecture for polar codes. SC is a low-complexity decoding algorithm with a set of sequential operations. The sequential processing nature
                        of SC limits parallelism but promotes not only pipelining but also multiple copies of SC decoder with an optimized pipeline depth to achieve Tb/s throughput. The MCSC decoder architecture consists of multiple SC decoders with lower
                        frequency and pipeline depth to process multiple codewords in parallel and to achieve lower power consumption. The pipeline depth of MCSC is optimized separately for each multicore configuration using register reduction/balancing
                        (RRB) method. This enables an efficient implementation for the 1-core, 2-core, 4-core and 8-core candidate MCSC decoders. To reduce the complexity of the implementation, an adaptive loglikelihood ratio (LLR) quantization scheme
                        is used for internal LLRs within the range of 1-5 bits. The post-placement-routing results at 28nm High-k Metal Gate (HKMG) ASIC technology show that 4-core MCSC decoder achieves 1 Tb/s throughput on 3.92 mm2 area with 1.55 pJ/bit
                        energy efficiency.

                        The source signal direction of arrival (DOA) estimation problem has been an active research area for decades with various applications. In many practical applications, the number of available snapshots is a critical parameter; the high complexity and
                        cost involved in deploying a separate front-end circuit in the analog domain for each antenna are challenging in the DOA estimation problem. In this work, we apply the compressive sampling (CS) technique to reduce the number of
                        required snapshots and the front-end circuits. We adaptively optimize the compressive sampling strategy in terms of both the number of required snapshots and active front-end circuits by exploiting the a priori probability distribution
                        of the source signal directions.
